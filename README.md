# Done
A simple to-do-list

I was tasked with creating a basic To-Do-List app with the following features using jQuery library:

- The user can add a new item to a list of items.
- The user can cross out an item from the list of items.
- The user can delete an item from the list of items.
- The user can change the order of items in the list of items.

I was given a code in Vanilla Java Script and was supposed to rewrite it using jQuery.

Two more changes to come:
- input bar to be empty after clicking on the Add button,
- allowing adding items not only via the Add button but also by the means of the Enter key.
